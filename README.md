# PolygonRailSystem
 This project is a recursive, polygon-based rail-system. Using an interactive drawing canvas, users begin with a randomly-colored 
 equilateral triangle. Different mouse clicks allow the user to increase or decrease the numbers of sides for 
 the polygon, or add another polygon ontop of an existing polygon. As polygons are added onto one another, the color of the 
 intersecting areas change based on the colors of the previous polygons. Below is an image of the program running.
